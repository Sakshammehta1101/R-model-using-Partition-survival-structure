# R-model-using-Partition-survival-structure
This R code implements a partitioned survival model to compare the cost-effectiveness of new intervention drug (gumarontinib) vs. standard of care drug (savolitinib) for treating non-small lung cancer in China. It performs survival extrapolation, calculates QALYs and costs, and conducts sensitivity analyses (DSA, PSA) to evaluate economic outcomes.
